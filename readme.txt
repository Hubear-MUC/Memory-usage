Memory Usage 5.0
----------------

With this program the implementation of data in- and output via directly using the standard- functions is tested.

Just invoke the program, it asks you to enter a number by an indivudually designed prompt (a<- ) and then outputs the numbers entered.

For both actions the standard- functions  printf()  and  scanf()  are used directly.

This is intended in the future because this is the normal way in using the C- programming language and the messages on the screen can be designed more flexible.






Changes:
--------

Version 5.0

Implementation of in- and output of data (a number) with standard- functions, no usage of the din() or dout() functions.


Version 4.0

Equipped with full user interaction so that the use of a debugger is not necessary anymore.


Version 3.1

Separation of the definition from the working code to make the code readable
more clearly.


Version 3.0:

Creation of an array, not just one variable. Thus first "real" memory usage
in a bigger amount.


Version 2.3:

Placed the closing curly bracket in a new line to make the code readable
more clearly and to make it possible to set a breakpoint after assigning
the used memory with content.
