Memory Usage 2.1

This program uses memory by defining an integer variable and assigning it
with a value.

While version 2.0 just initialized the variable by 0, in version 2.1 an
actual value is assigned.

Thus this also can be regarded as an initialization, the initialization by 0
fortunately did not have to be made due to the very limited code space.

This program just has to be invoked.
