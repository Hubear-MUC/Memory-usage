Memory Usage 2.3
----------------

The program just needs to be invoked.

The program makes use of system memory by defining an integer- variable and
assigning it with the value 21.

If the program is run with a debugger, at line 3 (at the closing curly bracket)
a breakpoint can be set to prevent the program from exiting, then the content 
of variable a can beregarded.

To learn how to use your debugger and how to compile to make the executbable
binary containing the neccessary debugging information please refer to
the documentation of your debugger.



Changes:
--------

Placed the closing curly bracket in a new line to make the code readable
more clearly and to make it possible to set a breakpoint after assigning
the used memory with content.
