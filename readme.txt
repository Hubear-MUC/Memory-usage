Memory Usage 4.0
----------------

The code of "Memory Usage" was completely rewritten in version 4.0

This program is the first one using the functions  in()  and  out()  by including the  incl.h - file to supply complete user interaction.

The program just needs to be invoked.

The program asks for entering a number and returns it after the entry is done.

For this the entered number is stored in a variable which makes this program using system memory.

The program terminates after showing the entered number on the screen (in the terminal).





Changes:
--------

Version 4.0

Equipped with full user interaction so that the use of a debugger is not necessary anymore.


Version 3.1

Separation of the definition from the working code to make the code readable
more clearly.


Version 3.0:

Creation of an array, not just one variable. Thus first "real" memory usage
in a bigger amount.


Version 2.3:

Placed the closing curly bracket in a new line to make the code readable
more clearly and to make it possible to set a breakpoint after assigning
the used memory with content.
