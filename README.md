# Memory-usage

Memory Usage 1.3

This program just has to be invoked.

Memory is allocated by a definition of an integer- variable.

The program does not perform any action. So the variable is not used yet.

The code was restructured to make it more clearly readable by setting the
closing curly bracket into the next line.
So the definition of main() now has its usual form.
