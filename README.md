Changes:

Version 2.3:

Placed the closing curly bracket in a new line to make the code readable
more clearly and to make it possible to set a breakpoint after assigning
the used memory with content.


Version 2.2:

- The code block of main() was placed in a new line to make the code readable
  more clearly

- The assigned value to variable a was increased to 20.


Version 2.1:

Replaced the initialization by 0 with an assignment of an actual number to variable a.
No assignment by 0 before due to limited code space.

Code Space : 20 bytes
