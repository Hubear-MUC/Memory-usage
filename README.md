Version history:

Version 5.0

Implementation of in- and output of data (a number) with standard- functions, no usage of the din() or dout() functions.


Version 4.0

Equipped with full user interaction so that the use of a debugger is not necessary anymore.


Version 3.1

Separation of the definition from the working code to make the code readable
more clearly.


Version 3.0:

Creation of an array, not just one variable. Thus first "real" memory usage
in a bigger amount.


Version 2.3:

Placed the closing curly bracket in a new line to make the code readable
more clearly and to make it possible to set a breakpoint after assigning
the used memory with content.


Version 2.2:

- The code block of main() was placed in a new line to make the code readable
  more clearly

- The assigned value to variable a was increased to 20.


Version 2.1:

Replaced the initialization by 0 with an assignment of an actual number to variable a.
No assignment by 0 before due to limited code space.
