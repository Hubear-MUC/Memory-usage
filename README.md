# Memory-usage
A program that uses memory

Memory Usage 1.0

This program is the first implementation of usage of system memory.

The program just needs to be invoked.

Although the program uses system memory it does not yet perform any actions
with it because the variable definition to make it use system memory used
up all the code space that was left beside of the main()- function.


Code Space : 14 bytes
